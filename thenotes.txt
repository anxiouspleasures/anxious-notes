March 30, 2020;Got restless. Made with the limited stuff I have on hand at home. iPhone. Budget printer. Transparency. Cyanotype that developed in the window of my 3rd floor apt. No makeup. Ice pack strapped to my head because I’ve had headaches on and off since Friday. What day is it? 

March 31, 2020;Don’t touch your face. Wish I could hug people. Days are blurry. Headache’s slightly better. So many bloopers to make this cyano today including forgetting to inverse the image, and printing the wrong image. Yesterday’s was way way too dark. And today’s is way too light. No makeup. Still in pajamas. iPhone photo. Budget laser printer. Cyano.

April 1, 2020;I find myself holding my breath when people jog past me while out on walks. I hold my breath in the elevator too but mostly take the stairs now. I still have headaches that I’m guessing are due to eye strain and a lack of long distance fields of sight in my small apartment. Walks are therapy. Cases are nearly a million today. Last night John Oliver made me laugh at times followed by anxiety. Woke at 4a thinking about refrigerated box trucks as seen in his last episode. #shelterinplace nitrile gloves, iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype 

April 2, 2020;In the face of scarcity, improvise. #shelterinplace delta airplane eye mask / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype. Also... some of these keep getting darker which is odd. So now I’m keeping them in a drawer to avoid light. Also my birthday is this month and I’m already bumming on how I have to spend it alone. 

April 3, 2020;Everything blurs. The minutes, the hours, the days, the weeks... the news, the updates, the fragility of it all. #shelterinplace / toilet paper / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype 

April 4, 2020;Listening. To rain. To birds. To faint laughter from somewhere. To car tires on wet asphalt. To my breath. #shelterinplace coffee filter / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype. Another blooper day with a super long exposure. This rain is trying to kill my spontaneity.

April 5, 2020;Grieve for the loss. Of time. Of touch. Of place. Of certainty. Grieve for the collapse of the world we once knew. Then sing if you can find your voice. #shelterinplace Cloth napkin, silk scarf / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype. Almost didn’t get to make this today. The rain lasted through most of it and it took 3 tries and finally a 3-1/2 hr long exposure that worked.

April 6, 2020;The day is a year and a second all at once. The numbers soaring. The birds outside my window singing without a clue as to why we’ve all retreated.  From a New York Times article that resonates and hangs there in my thoughts. “... recovery will be watched worldwide for lessons on how populations move past pain and calamity of such staggering magnitude... The experience of death and near-death has left psychic wounds.” #shelterinplace houseplant / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype

April 7, 2020;Loss. Of. Words. The world spins blindly to the hum of sirens and nature taking the land back. #shelterinplace produce bags / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype 

April 8, 2020;I wandered until I got lost. And then I wandered some more. 

April 9, 2020;The week slipped by like water despite the overabundance of minutes in each day. “Seismologists have been able to hear the earth’s natural vibrations more clearly as the everyday hum of humanity has grown quieter.” #shelterinplace overgrowth / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 10, 2020;Slowly emptying the fridge and the cupboards before foraging the anxious aisles once more. Holding and savoring everything with the new weight of gratitude and pleasure. A tomato, a can of beans, single ply toilet paper. The fruits of the day we once took for granted.

April 11, 2020;Boredom, longing and fatigue tangle. How I could go for a road trip. A meal outside of my kitchen. A moment on a beach. A normal grocery experience. A laugh over drinks. A hug. A kiss. Anything but this. #shelterinplace assorted plastic bags / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 12, 2020;(Monday) Counting the days. I don’t know why I do this. I don’t know why I do any of this. I tried not to but I grew weary. So I keep on doing. And doing. Until we are allowed to do more. I’ve grown fond of these rituals and will miss them when our lives grow busy and frantic again. #latergram I got supplies quicker than anticipated. I shot this portrait on April 13th but made the cyanotype today. #shelterinplace all the kitchen towels I could find and one nitrile glove / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype 

April 13, 2020;Day 29 (Tuesday). Toiletries, face mask, towels / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype/

April 14, 2020;Yesterday’s pain feels so trivial now. It also feels like it never occurred although I can look back and feel it radiating and feel the touch of the many doctors and physical therapists I saw for my knee. How much I took that touch for granted. How grateful I am that it’s behind me. #shelterinplace Compression stockings, leftover gauze and elastic bandage, painkillers from October’s knee surgery/ iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 15, 2020;The rituals of getting dressed for the world are temporarily ruptured. #shelterinplace All of my jeans / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 16, 2020;The mind strays. And strays. And strays. Sometimes at 3am in the dead of sleep. #shelterinplace ran out of citrus / iPhone photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype

April 17, 2020;Turns out bubble wrap is quite transparent to the lens (basically didn’t show up in the photo) as is my mood (which maybe shows) of being on day 32 of living alone during a quarantine that forces distance beyond distance beyond distance. I’m grateful but I’m tired. I know this time will end and I’ll look back and appreciate the forced rest and downtime. For now... #shelterinplace bubble wrap from things people send me / dslr photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 18, 2020;One day this will seem a dream... a story too unlikely to be real #shelterinplace kitchen wares / dslr photo/ budget laser printer on transparency / cyanotype.

April 19, 2020;Modern day foraging with a guest appearance by the printer error code that got spit out on the first round. And a rainbow that fell on the print as I was documenting it. Reusable bags.

April 20, 2020;The constant ebb and flow of lethargy and spark. My pillow crown faded into the wall and maneuvering in a weighted blanket proved intensely difficult. Bedding, weighted blanket.

April 21, 2020;Procrastinating everything. Trash bag, packing paper, window curtain, calla lilies.

April 22, 2020;Thinking about separation of space while quarantined in a studio apartment. Places of work, learning, exercise, creation, sleep and sustenance blur into one. The negative for this print must have bowed while exposing in the sun because the hand blurs as is moving and the light shifts once more. Packing cubes, luggage straps.

April 23, 2020;Who knew we would be here this long. Who knew how many facets this would alter. Who knew how our futures would change immediately and slowly at once. Various bath towels, toiletry basket, earrings, silk scarf.

April 24, 2020;Everything is changing every second this goes on. Duvet cover, reflector, bullet casings made into jewelry.

April 25, 2020;How do we move forward from here without fear? How much are we all packing in right now because processing is too much in the face of simply enduring? Fabric, bathrobe, tissue, foil from leftovers, cheese grater, wilted calla lilies.

April 26, 2020;Yesterday blurred into today because all the days blur and shift and cling to one another.  Yesterday’s fabric, silk scarf, floral dress with nowhere to go.

April 27, 2020;Hold tight to what toilet paper you have. Taken on the eve of my birthday. Shower curtain, used toilet paper rolls, toilet paper plastic packaging over my face.

April 28, 2020;Makeshift quarantine birthday festivities.  Trash bag birthday dress, six pack plastic tiara with shoestring bow, solo cup bouquet of stolen flowers, beanie, silicon lid, robe tie.

April 29, 2020;Patterns collected over a decade of various travels reminding me that I would love to travel. And that quarantine is a series of chaotic and calm pattern. The days blur. The weeks blur. Here we all are. Pillow cover and skirt from thrift stores in Oregon and California, woven bag bought in Canyon de Chelly - Navajo Nation.

April 30, 2020;In an ideal world I would be making portraits of others right now slowly and closely. Not from 6-10+ feet away. Instead I’ve been turning towards myself for company. Spent the morning wondering when this chapter will ease. And how much of the art world will be left standing. Small galleries, large galleries, museums, nonprofits, residency spaces, institutions, art schools, art teachers, artists, dancers, musicians, film makers.... all just wait in the wake. Hoping for the best. Camera and lens wraps, obsolete cable release, reflector.

May 1, 2020;Left thirsty. La Croix box and can trash.  

May 2, 2020;The rubbish piles up and up and then fills the earth somewhere.  Birthday take out containers and delivery bag, beach towel I cannot use for the beaches are closed.

May 3, 2020;We all keep searching for ways to exist and move forward and survive in this moment. It’s a daily quest. Some days more tiring than others. Three trash bags, nitrile gloves, hand indigo dyed blanket I made with my best friend before moving.

May 4, 2020;Spring bloom. Some days I realize I haven’t spoken once. Other days I’m tethered to screens and phones as a means of seeing others. Closet Genie magic hanger I never use, 11 yr old bridesmaid gift bag from my oldest friend, birthday tulips from Janet. Silk scarf from Chanin.

May 5, 2020;Ode to Frida on cinco de mayo. Old Navy Sarong, borrowed flowers.

May 6, 2020;Asking so many questions into the void these days. Everything affects and alters everything. Nothing is left as it was. Thrift store fabric and price tag, bubble wrap, pajamas.

May 7, 2020;All eyes on us while we’re held in place. Yesterday shifted and holds me still in this moment.  Thrift store fabric and price tag pinned to the wall, eye shirt by tigerowl .

May 8, 2020;Summer is upon us. It’s super hot and there is nowhere to go. My printer rejected transparency sheets entirely today and so I attempted a paper negative. Sadly this makes my image very muddy and much of the detail has been lost. Several swim suits, yoga shorts, swim goggles, large plastic bag.

May 9, 2020;Multi-task everything and get next to nothing done. Also make large decisions with the largest uncertainty any of us have dealt with in our lives. Oh and I somehow got my printer to work today.  Several more swim suits, shark towel for swimming I cannot do, comb, plastic bubble packing tubes.

May 10, 2020;Artifacts of self care that I can’t force myself to use or are no longer needed. Heating pad and cover, yoga mat, tens machine and pads, yoga grip glove bag.

May 11, 2020;Anxiety, indecision, urgency and the ever abundance of the illusion of time. There is no sense of time other than I blink and the sun is going down on day 56. Painting rag from daily drawing/watercolor, random patterns. Back to paper negatives. Overcast sky made this a 1-1/2 hr on the roof of my car exposure while reading inside of it.

May 12, 2020;Evidence and illusion. Shields and separateness. Pot/pan separators, paper, leopard fabric. Accidental fingerprints from struggling to coax my printer and consequently printing on the wrong side of the transparency.

May 13, 2020;Reflections and balancing acts. Noticing small sites of mourning/loss. Noticing less concern. Noticing small acts of defiance. Noticing my wandering, ever anxious mind spinning at ungodly hours. Two hour long exposure due to dark skies. Popcorn bag, bungee cord, steel hangers, hanging fabric.

May 14, 2020;Movement, time, temporary space. I thought today was Wednesday and then later that it was Friday. Never did I think today was Thursday until it was pointed out. Time is abstract. Last night I had a dream I was bear hugging everyone I knew but then was immediately concerned about our covid fragility. Window curtain, bungee cord, reflector, accidental finger prints, water prints.

May 15, 2020;Sleep is evasive. The mind spins like a top. Multiple eye masks, neck pillow, scarf, thrift dress.

May 16, 2020;Eating my way through the pandemic. Unpredictable highlight blow out with cyanotypes. Cereal boxes, almond/cashew milk box.

May 17, 2020;I keep getting these headaches right in the middle of my forehead. Not enough water? Too much screen time? Strained eyes? I’m not sure. The pandemic moves on and doesn’t seem concerned about the day to day or long term impacts of being primarily alone and indoors. Gifts in the mail from a friend - shipping envelope and bubble wrap, new earrings, hand stamped tea towel.

May 18, 2020;How is it day 63?! Grad school feels over already. I barely began. Had leg surgery 3 weeks into being here that had me limited for the majority my first two quarters and had me in and out of doctor’s offices and in physical therapy. As soon as that ended the pandemic stepped in. I barely remember being here now even as every square inch of my surroundings is a reminder of what was. So curious what next year brings for me. And for students. And for all of us. Window curtain, plastic bags, pajamas.

May 19, 2020;Thinking about fragility on my 50th day in a row of self portraits. Napkins,l Paper towels. Scarves. 

May 20, 2020;Self reflecting . Turns out being stuck alone for months on end makes you reassess what led you here. Or at least it does for me. Tin foil, bike light, string, mirror.

May 21, 2020;Nature has been my closest companion these past 66 days. More so than ever. Last week I paused and clung to a redwood and felt it humming quietly in the silence of the woods. Touching things that are alive is amazing and needed. Kitchen towel, curtain, eucalyptus gathered on walks.

May 22, 2020;Growing weary. The days feel blurry and pointless to count yet I can’t stop counting them. Always with the self-constructed regiments. Always with the rules and formulas. Always with me. Just before taking out the recycling. Whole Foods bag used to ripen avocados, things I’ve had to drink, trash bags.

May 23, 2020;Indecision vs inability vs. unwillingness. Things I used to wear under dresses when being fancy but temporarily have no use for: 3 pairs of nylons, 2 slips.

May 24, 2020;Today brings repercussions of overindulgence. I am foggy and moving in slow motion. I need extra air and sun. House plant, mask my aunt made me, fabric from thrift store, shorts that I barely ever wear (that michael wore).

May 25, 2020;Supplies are dwindling. I have roughly 28 more sheets of cyano materials and about 40 some-odd transparency sheets. I never knew I would be in this situation for so long. Had I known maybe I would have reconsidered my commitment to making one of these daily until shelter in place is lifted. Oh and I had to switch printers and this one made random banding and a thinner layer of ink on the neg. Cyanotype packaging.

May 26, 2020;Uprooted and uncomfortable in my own skin. Constantly aware of the body and how women are told since birth how to use it and show it. My eyes look dark. Thrift fabrics and plant started from a cutting that has since outgrown its environment.

May 27, 2020;Geography of the body and topography of its place. 72 days without human touch. I had another dream about hugging someone deeply. One day. Hopefully soon. Thinnest blanket I can find during a heatwave. This heatwave sun is power blasting my exposures. I keep making these too dark and my printer is still banding but don’t have enough supplies to make additional images. It is what it is.

May 28, 2020;My eyes feel blurry today. And I’ve just exited two zoom meetings in a row about stressful deadlines in my near future. Trash bag, shoe packaging, onion bag, string.

May 29, 2020;Holding my breath with aloof answers. Practicing during pause. The world shakes violently with the weight of our own actions. - Gifts from others. Trader Joe’s bag, plastic bag, card envelope, transparency sheet, heatwave pajamas.

May 30, 2020;Say something. Makeshift armor. Grief. Anger. Packaging from transparency sheets, rice cooker, metal basket, metal straws, string, trash bag, rubberband.

May 31, 2020;Feeling helpless as I watch massive abuses of power ripple across the country at protests. They come as no surprise but make me weep just the same. Drawstring bag, egg cartons, tissues, string.-- Sun just wouldn’t break through. Lost a lot of the detail in the highlights due to lack of light while exposing the cyano. Trivial problems during a global pandemic and nationwide acts of violence.

June 1, 2020;Of all the thoughts on loop in my head, there are some that loop the loudest with the least resolve. Small rug, string, toilet paper, used toilet paper rolls.

June 2, 2020;Refrained from posting anything personal on black out Tuesday. Here is day 78 cloaked in uncertain moments and feeling powerless. The neg printed so so so thin that the image barely surfaced. There is so much more detail that got lost. The exposure was only 3 min. Trash bags, string, foam roller, six pack plastic, wool scarves.

June 3, 2020;Wearing the past and wandering forward. Unwoven image from my family archive. Scarf that was gifted by a dear friend. Sorrow. Hope.

June 4, 2020;Day 80. Day 80. Day 80. In 10 days I will have sheltered in place alone for 3 months straight. So grateful for outdoor spaces that allow me to see people safely. Community is so needed now. I want so many hugs. Umbrella, yard coat, paint set, shoelace.

June 5, 2020;My family once co-owned Rancho Boca de Santa Monica (mouth of Santa Monica), a 6,656-acre Mexican land grant in present day Los Angeles given by governor Juan Alvarado in 1839 to Ysidro Reyes (my greatxxxx grandfather and Francisco Marquez. Now we own none of it and most of it is private property).  This is a slide of the landscape from my family archive projected on top of me. Projection, swimsuit, goggles, swim cap.

June 6, 2020;Things consumed and the blanket that covered my restless body last night. Today the fatigue burns like a residue. Beer packaging, string, hand-dyed blanket.

June 7, 2020;Unravel. (first day of being single in over seven years) Packing paper that once wrapped my camera in transit.

June 8, 2020;Tangled in each moment. The world is uneasy in the wake of all that we are witnessing. As am I. As am I. But grateful for this movement. Assorted bags that say thank you.

June 9, 2020;Running out of steam. Running out of time. And running out of props. Today was my 71st day of making these. Haven’t missed a day since March 31st. Produce bags, wooden beads, earrings, paper towels, hand made dress, fabric.

June 10, 2020;Ruptures and songs and grief and joy and anxiety and calm and being and being and being. The sea, the wind, clothes, hair, self, (post-covid test).

June 11, 2020;First year of grad school is behind me... Pizza box, fabric, dried leaves.

June 12, 2020;Waiting while being. Bubble wrap, air tubes, paper sheets, sheer fabric. Printer scratches.

June 13, 2020;A few more days... til sheltering in place elsewhere. Packing peanuts, plastic sheeting, plastic pouch.

June 14, 2020;90 days. On the cusp of starting the count over. Things I should be packing. Earrings, jewelry rack, towels.

June 15, 2020;Props are tossed or packed or elsewhere... thoughts are too. Less focus lately but still willingness. Things I got in the mail during a pandemic.

June 16, 2020;My printer spontaneously ran out of ink without warning but since I already shot my portrait I figured to share the piles of laundry on me that I need to pack or store.

June 17, 2020;Cusp of change. Still out of ink but still shooting my portrait daily... the days are getting stranger as life gets compartmentalized and crammed into luggage and boxes. I begin solo teaching remotely Monday in the midst of all that is unsettled. Excited and nervous and feeling pulled in many directions. 

June 18, 2020;Relocated. Not sure if I’ll keep making these since they were always about being in isolation during the Bay Area shelter in place order. And now I’m isolating with others.... and not in the Bay. And have no printer as of yet.

June 19, 2020;Relocated. Acclimating. Full of indecision. Ocean at my back. Mountains before me. 

June 20, 2020;Inside my head. Cyano fail with a paper negative and way too little light. Literally nothing surfaced.

June 21, 2020;Dog days of summer... with Bitz on my head. Accidentally looking cranky but it’s because her little paws were shoving my face around just before this was taken.

June 22, 2020;But not in the Bay Area for shelter in Place any longer.

June 23, 2020;Masks on masks and pandemic hair growth. Another paper negative with all the blur that brings. The world is opening up as Covid cases multiply.

June 24, 2020;I draped my hair over branches of a lavender bush but they are all lost to the shadows. A bee landed inches from my eye when taking this and a dog jumped on this mid exposure and somehow the paper negative wasn’t too disrupted. Day 100. Moving for the 2nd time in a week today.

June 25, 2020;Temporary places to call home. Everything is changing. I trimmed my bangs into a sink and noticed how much has gone silver and gray. 

June 26, 2020;Bells ring various songs on the hour. The humidity keeps anything from truly drying. I have a huge pile of work to do and all I want to do is run off into the open... with feelings and stories tucked into my chest. As the covid surges on and on. The joys of summer.

June 27, 2020;All I can hear while trying to work today is a man with a megaphone yelling Hail Mary Full of Grace on loop from the feet of the Junipero Serra statue down the street. Blinded by the light.... despite the history trail that shows us how Serra founded the mission system in CA... forcing mass assimilation, genocide, imprisonment, torture and more upon people (some of my family included) that had been here thousands of years.

June 28, 2020;Wearing my mother’s pearls. No printer for now. 

June 29, 2020;Half dressed. New teaching clothes. Wanting more touch. But not. Cause... Covid. No printer for now. 

June 30, 2020;I keep going. I question it daily. And then I stumble forward more. I have made these for 92 days in a row as the country feels on the cusp of a new round of lock downs. Circumstances changed, my environment changed multiple times. My personal life changed in ways I don’t know how to share. These portraits changed. My energy has changed. But I still can’t seem to stop making these. For now.

July 1, 2020;Multitasking and forgetting. And wondering. The quiet is so strange at times. I keep thinking I’ll get used to it...

July 2, 2020;“The days wash over in the blink of an eye. It’s already after 6p. The sun is still shining bright.”

July 3, 2020;Looking through and around. Confusion and excitement intersect.

July 4, 2020;Wait. Learn. Push through. Plan. The numbers soar as I try to sort an exit strategy.

July 5, 2020.Finding a place to be and holding it for now. Paying attention to triumphs. And of course discomforts large and small... often shining light on things of avoidance or oblivion.

July 6, 2020;Testing hurdles and boundaries.

July 7, 2020;Fool’s gold. Mirage. Make believe. Bluff. Feign. Fool. 4 yr olds flower girl dress, reflector with cover.

July 8, 2020;Nobody brought me here to this specific time and place but sometimes I feel myself longing to point anywhere but in. Today I have a bit of pandemic fatigue/weariness/ache... not sure what. Maybe just woke on the wrong side of the bed. But it’s there. And I’m faced with it. And am sure it’ll pass. And return. And pass again. Almost 12 million reported Covid cases worldwide... over 3 million here alone. Cannot wait for less anxious times but will. Cannot wait for a more regular sense of togetherness and closeness. My closest friend’s grandmother’s shawl.

July 9, 2020;Practicing gratitude while confronted with self. And self in relation to others. Burrito take out bag from taqueria. Fitted sheet. Hand towel.

July 10, 2020;Truce flag. Borrowed homemade flag.

July 11, 2020;Looking outward rather than inward. Mirror, lights, fabric.

July 12, 2020;No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, my body and brain buzz through the night. I feel like I am sleepwalking through piles of work. Borrowed Tigerowl handmade pillow. Bath towel. Pajamas.

July 13, 2020;Emerging after a weekend of hiding behind a desk.Borrowed umbrella and dish towels.

July 14, 2020;Day 120 of Shelter in Place. Washes/waves of emotion sneak up on me. Lately I’ve been feeling all of them. Borrowed baby tutu/toy tutu, sarong. 1/5

July 15, 2020;Blink and a day dissolves into minutes and months all at once. Time does not seem like time these days. Challenging myself to use the same two simple props for a few days. Also challenged. Literally. By life these days. But who isn’t. Borrowed baby tutu/toy tutu, sarong. ⅖

July 16, 2020;Telling myself through stubborn resistance to open the gates if needing to grieve. That stagnant waters are just that. Borrowed baby tutu/toy tutu, sarong. 3/5

July 17, 2020;Alleviating pressure. Feeling weights lift. Borrowed baby tutu/toy tutu, sarong. ⅘

July 18, 2020;The illusion of multiple barriers when there are in fact none. Day 124. Attempting communication from afar and all ends in tangle momentarily. Borrowed baby tutu/toy tutu, sarong. 5/5

July 19, 2020;Been thinking a lot about unintentional or unavoidable chain reactions these days.... being on both ends of causing and being in pain. Humans are so damn complicated. I’m trying to shake my ego and find and sit with patience. Day 125. Telepathy fail. Communication break downs. Sending smoke signals. Borrowed knee pad bag, hand dyed beaded necklace, robe. 1/5

July 20, 2020;Today I have felt. That is all.  Collective touch without touch without touch without touch. Pajamas, borrowed robe 2/5

July 21, 2020;Slow moving today. Day 127. Somewhat uneasy but less so than yesterday. Borrowed knee pad bag and robe. ⅗

July 22, 2020;Performance with space holding absence holding space holding me. Borrowed knee pad bag, hand dyed beaded necklace, robe. ⅘

July 23, 2020;Daydreaming and remembering. And realizing several months ago I used to hold my breath when people got too close. Day 129. Imagining touch when touch is impossible. Pajamas, borrowed knee pad bag, hand dyed beaded necklace, robe. 5/5

July 24, 2020;Blue washes fading by sunset. Pajamas, borrowed tissue paper, fabric and ribbons from Sage’s half birthday. ⅕

July 25, 2020;Missing unpinpointable things. So many shifting moods these days. Day 131. That’s insane. Pajamas, borrowed tissue paper, fabric and ribbons from Sage’s half birthday. ⅖

July 26, 2020;Tangled in fatigue and all too fixated on the nearing reality of returning to the Bay and deeper levels of zoom life in the fall. Pajamas, borrowed tissue paper, fabric and ribbons from Sage’s half birthday. ⅗

July 27, 2020;Overthinking at odd hours. Day 133. Borrowing from Richard Ross who borrowed from Reginald Dwayne Betts who writes on his time in prison but resonates on our collective time in isolation so well with this simple line... “The relentless abundance of days...” and here we are in the thick of them. Pajamas, borrowed tissue paper, fabric and ribbons from Sage’s half birthday. 4/5

July 28, 2020;Casting doubt with varying forecasts. Pajamas, borrowed tissue paper, fabric and ribbons from Sage’s half birthday. 5/5

July 29, 2020;Emails that express nothing and something but not enough. “We are living through an extraordinary time...” “...for the unforeseeable future..” “We thank you for your continued perseverance, as we navigate these challenges together...” Pajamas, grapefruit bag, borrowed floral wreath and butterfly wing costume. ⅕

July 30, 2020;The first slow day in days and days. Abundant. Bathing suit, grapefruit bag, borrowed floral wreath and butterfly wing costume. 2/5

July 31, 2020;What traces remain... these strange days feel apocalyptic at times. Day 137. Woke at 6:30a. The rest has been a blur and a sigh. Pandemic problem solving on the cusp of August. <br> Pajamas, grapefruit bag, borrowed floral wreath and butterfly wing costume. ⅗

August 1, 2020;3:30/7:30a wake up pattern.  As we near five months of what we all in the early naive days thought would pass quick enough to return to normalcy by late Spring/Summer... the perseverance I keep getting thanked for is running low. Some days I am able to forget about the threat of simply being... but am snapped back to when I see my masks hanging by the door. The new normal. Sheltering our face from one another. Borrowed butterfly wing costume. ⅘ <br> 

August 2, 2020;A hint of more warmth on the horizon. And momentarily forgetting weight. <br> Bathing suit, grapefruit bag. Borrowed butterfly wing costume and floral wreath. 5/5

August 3, 2020;The mind startles awake to dreams of crowds. Startles with a bang, a shuffle, a parade of useless thoughts before the day is day. Day 140. Slow dancing with anxiety. <br> Borrowed fitted bedsheet, vintage baby dress, hand-braided rope. ⅕

August 4, 2020;Stubborn adaptation. Daydreams. Broken sleep.  Wondering if the paths were meant to go anywhere. Wondering what I left behind and what may have left me behind. Wondering how many times I’ll start over. Pandemic pondering as we all face open ended uncertainty. These questions both hold weight and nothing all at once. They are just there, scratching. <br> Borrowed fitted bedsheet, vintage baby dress, hand-braided rope. 2/5

The Wait.

It is life in slow motion,
it's the heart in reverse,
it's a hope-and-a-half:
too much and too little at once.
It's a train that suddenly
stops with no station around,
and we can hear the cricket,
and, leaning out the carriage
door, we vainly contemplate
a wind we feel that stirs
the blooming meadows, the meadows
made imaginary
by this stop.
- Rilke

Bathing suit, things found on walks, napkins stained by coffee and watercolor paint, borrowed costume piece 5/5.

September 5, 2020;Unconditional. I spent several hours cleaning my dad’s apartment and left a care package for him at the steps of the nursing home.  It wasn’t until I sat in my car with the sun beating in my eyes that I collapsed in sorrow.

“Who says that all must vanish?
Who knows, perhaps the flight
of the bird you wound remains,
and perhaps flowers survive
caresses in us, in their ground.

It isn't the gesture that lasts,
but it dresses you again in gold
armor —from breast to knees—
and the battle was so pure
an Angel wears it after you.”
-Rainer Maria Rilke

Still thinking a lot about the scarcity and anxiety surrounding touch and breath during a time in history where both are potentially life threatening.

October 6, 2020;Up before the sun. Medical appointments. Caretaker.

“You see, I want a lot.
Maybe I want it all: the darkness of each endless fall, the shimmering light of each ascent....
You are not dead yet, it's not too late to open your depths by plunging into them and drink in the life that reveals itself quietly there.” ― Rainer Maria Rilke

Day 209. Confronted with what I have neglected... but content with where it lies. My clean laundry is literally a mountain to be sorted and put away but I don’t want to do it so I haven’t. And I am ok with this.

One of many translations.

“Silence laden with air, light and sky.
In the transparent silence,
The day’s repose:
Space’s transparence was
The silence’s transparence.
The languid light from the sky
Soothed the grass as it grew.
The Earth’s critters, amidst stones,
Were stones under the same light.
Time had its fill in but one minute.
In the listless quietness,
Noon got consummated.

And then a bird sang, like a thin arrow.
Hurt in its silver bosom,
the sky trembled,
The leaves rustled,
The grass awakened…
And I then grasped how
death is like an arrow,
That someone shoots
unbeknownst to us,
And in the wink of an eye
we are dead.”
-Octavio Paz

October 21, 2020;Denial and revelations leaving me with stomach knots. <br> I got horrible news about my dad’s health today. No costume. No ability to turn around. 

October 22, 2020;Dental floss tied to finger. Remember. 

The day comes
and each morning I look off
searching the ground
for its coming,
checking the walls and clouds
and sense how the sun
becomes hotter
how the sidewalks crack hair-thin
and grass tips forward in the breeze
everything seems to
crawl out of hiding
in the death of who I was,
I sing the highest notes I reach,
singing as never before
a bright blooded fervor
incanting in my silence
the burning wreckage
as an offering of my past
in this waiting
that has become a temple.

To Say Before Going to Sleep

I would like to sing someone to sleep,
have someone to sit by and be with.
I would like to cradle you and softly sing,
be your companion while you sleep or wake.
I would like to be the only person
in the house who knew: the night outside was cold.
And would like to listen to you
and outside to the world and to the woods.

The clocks are striking, calling to each other,
and one can see right to the edge of time.
Outside the house a strange man is afoot
and a strange dog barks, wakened from his sleep.
Beyond that there is silence.

My eyes rest upon your face wide-open;
and they hold you gently, letting you go
when something in the dark begins to move.
-Rainer Maria Rilke

I imagine
The day will arrive
When all of this...
When what we’ve 
Weathered
En Masse
Will feel 
Absurd.

Too insignificant
To remember
In full
Too large 
To forget
As we step 
Into a crowded market
A spontaneous
Embrace
An airplane 
Shooting
Across
The sky 
Like a Star
A sweaty
Dance 
A kiss
Un
Masked

I imagine
Once granted
We will all spill 
Into each other

Basking in 
The chaos and 
Murmur of normalcy 

How
Booming
I imagine 
Laughter
Yelling
Singing

Even whispering
Will feel like fireworks
Against the softness 
Of our ears.




January 17, 2021;Last night I had a dream that I was at a film screening in a park. It was densely crowded with people laughing and squeezing in to watch together. I didn’t know anyone and was sandwiched between a man and a group of children. I fell asleep on the man’s shoulder while the film played and instead of waking me or nudging me off he simply put his arm around me and let me sleep. (Skirt, branch of white sage)

White flowers (Mary Oliver) (gifted flowers)

Last night
in the fields
I lay down in the darkness
to think about death,
but instead I fell asleep,
as if in a vast and sloping room
filled with those white flowers
that open all summer,
sticky and untidy,
in the warm fields.
When I woke
the morning light was just slipping
in front of the stars,
and I was covered
with blossoms.
I don’t know
how it happened—
I don’t know
if my body went diving down
under the sugary vines
in some sleep-sharpened affinity
with the depths, or whether
that green energy
rose like a wave
and curled over me, claiming me
in its husky arms.
I pushed them away, but I didn’t rise.
Never in my life had I felt so plush,
or so slippery,
or so resplendently empty.
Never in my life
had I felt myself so near
that porous line
where my own body was done with
and the roots and the stems and the flowers
began.

March 19, 2021;Windows (A towel I wish I had never touched)

March 20, 2021;Slumber wear (I wish I had never touched and the last time I saw you in person)

March 21, 2021;Scarcity of materials. It seems everyone in the world is making cyanotypes with digital negatives these days because everything I normally use is sold out or priced up. Squirreling away some materials in the hopes I can keep going a while longer. Though everything has shifted since this all began for me a year ago.

March 22, 2021;On biting one’s tongue. Over sharing / under sharing.

March 23, 2021;Constellation of freckles, indentations from sleep and a burn that will swiftly turn into a tan from yesterday’s sun.

March 24, 2021;Meditations on things falling apart.  Today I had an email with the subject line “When Everything’s Burning, Keep Dancing” and it feels relevant to everything these days.

March 26, 2021;On confronting self/introspection.

March 29, 2021;Camouflaged. Tomorrow marks 365 days of making these. I’m feeling the Covid fatigue.

March 30, 2021;Today is the anniversary of starting these portraits. One year ago I had headaches for a week and thought I maybe had covid. I took a portrait with an ice pack wrapped around my head because it looked so ridiculous and posted it. Here we are 365 days later. I get my second vaccine on April 10th. (Dying flowers)

April 7, 2021;Almond eyes. Dark spots. Bed head. Makeshiftness/bras. 3 days to a 2nd vaccine.

April 9, 2021;Hanging things up. Tomorrow I get my 2nd vaccine. Tomorrow is my last day count/walk/self portrait and then I am releasing myself from these projects. It’s been great to have something to focus on daily during such unstable times... but I have a ton brewing for an exciting Fall and I need to make room in my head/day/studio practice.

April 10, 2021;Release. Today I got my 2nd vaccine. I hope we all come out of this at some point.  So many have been lost along the way.
